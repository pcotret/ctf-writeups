# The intruder

We suspect a detective to be investigating the same case as us. He has a bad habit of trying to retrieve our information, so he could be among you. We know that he regularly creates YouTube channels during these investigations. Can you find the ID of his current YouTube channel? Something that may help: he usually pay tribute to a detective born in 1819, using his name as 
pseudonym.

What if Pinkerton was a player of the CTF ?
