**Challenge 5** I am working on a very important OSINT case. A contact sent me an image from a camera filming adriatic sea, but couldn't give me the source... My contact just told me that the camera is set on an hotel in Veneto, maybe that will help you to find this camera. One more thing... From this camera, we can see a panel where "Fantasy" is written. If you can find this camera, give me the phone number of the hotel (format: !c5-39XXXXXXXXXX).
