# He is back

A collegue you haven't seen in a year runs into your office screaming : "IT WAS THE WRONG KERMIT!!!! The one I'm looking for is the third of his name and he had a grandparent who wrote something just after the great war. There is something interesting in his second novel, about the actor he will see to take the role of the main character in a movie theater". He vanishes before you can even open your mouth to talk with him. Maybe you can find the actor he was talking about...

Format : HEXA{name}

## Method

- Searched "Kermit great war" leads us to Kermit Roosevelt, Theodore's son. Nothing here...

- "The third of his name": [Kermit Roosevelt III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_Roosevelt_III) is from the same family and an author.

- His second novel, *Allegiance*, published in 2015, was a Harper Lee Prize finalist.

- Found a review of the novel on [harvardwood.org/mp201510](https://www.harvardwood.org/mp201510)

> “Cash Harrison is truly my bigger and more violent alter ego,” larks Roosevelt, “although I can see him being played on the big screen by someone quietly charismatic like Joseph Gordon-Levitt.”

## Solution

```
HEXA{Joseph Gordon-Levitt}
```
