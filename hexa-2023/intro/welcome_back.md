# Welcome back

Dear agents,
You provided an outstanding work with the Manipar case just over a year 
ago. This group of activists, who met on Erasmus, stole data from 
sensitive sectors (bank, healthcare, military), to resell them to the 
highest bidders.
With their arrest, this case is therefore closed. However, their leader,
 Lucilhe Dumarquais disappeared during a transfer. She intended to 
reveal more information about collaborating criminal organizations. 
Since then, there is no trace of her.

The investigation reached a dead end. The minister asked to carry on.
 Given your knowledge of the case, you are assigned to take over and 
understand this disappearance.

We will ask you to provide every answer onto that format:

HEXA{challenge_answer} (case insensitive, dash/underscore/space accepted but do not mix, no accent).

If you understood the instructions, write HEXA{Briefing_OK}.

## Solution

```
HEXA{Briefing_OK}
```
