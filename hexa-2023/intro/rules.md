# Rules

Dear players, before the fun begins we need you to agree to several rules and a disclaimer:

DISCLAIMER:
This CTF depicts a **fictional** case.
Trigger warning: crimes, drugs, gambling.
If you feel uneasy with some of these subjects, we advise you not to 
participate.
It is also recommended to apply the same OPSEC as if you were on a real 
OSINT case as using a virtual machine, a VPN and sockpuppets for 
example.

**HEXA team disclaim all responsibility for the players' actions during the CTF.**

RULES:

1. On some challenges, you'll have attempts' limit, to avoid 
   bruteforce. WARNING: if you reach the max attempts, challenge will be 
   locked and you'll have to contact an admin (**TheBaboon#0575**, **ALS#4141** or **IWH#0728** on Discord) to unlock the challenge. Unlocking a challenge this way will make you lose all points related to the challenge.

2. Engaging rule : use only passive actions - do not call, do not 
   email, do not engage any contact with targets, unless a challenge 
   explicitly mentions it. Some challenges may mention real events or 
   public personalities, reminder that the given scenario is fictional and 
   people/event are not aware of it, or really linked to it...

3. This is an OSINT challenge, no offensive actions are required, such as : bruteforce, doxxing, vulnerability exploit...

4. Sharing hints or flags is prohibited, even if you have two teams 
   from the same school/company... If you have any question regarding the 
   challenges, a hint or a flag, contact exclusively TheBaboon#0575, 
   ALS#4141 or IWH#0728 on Discord.
