# Where are you

Well done, we know where she went  recently. We must continue to seek her presence on social media. This  person seems to bring her phone wherever she goes, and her favorite key  is #. Format: Flag{you_will_know_this_is_a_flag}

## Solution

Hashtags are mainly used on Twitter. However, we don't know the username of Ema Peetars on Twitter. We were stuck for a while on this until we paid for a hint: it told us that tweets can be geolocated! (how could I forgot that... Especially with the challenge title).

If we try to search on Twitter with the location of the building in Malta, we find a Twitter account!

```
geocode:35.8804077,14.3976566,0.1km
