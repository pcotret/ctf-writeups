# Roman encryption

We intercepted an encrypted communication that was meant to be delivered to a threat actor named Julius. Apparently his name is the key to decipher this message. Can you decipher it?

Looking at the challenge name, I tried:

- [Caesar decipher](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher)
- [Vigen√®re decipher](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher)

Nothing with those two algorithms... Tried an online substitution decipher https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver:

Some characters are wrong but we get a readable text for the main part. Let's try to complete the substitution alphabet with https://www.dcode.fr/substitution-cipher
