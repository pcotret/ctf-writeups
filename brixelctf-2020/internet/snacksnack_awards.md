# Snack Snack awards

A friend of mine owns a snackbar and is entered in a competition to win an award. It seems he is not going to win because he has a low amount of votes :( Do you think you can boost his votes? adding 5000 votes at once should do the trick! His snackbar is called Cafetaria 't pleintje
