# Sea code

beep beep beeeep... This one should be fairly straight forward **This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format**

## Walkthrough

Sea + "beep beeeep" makes me think about Morse code. https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html is able to decode the WAV file in text.

## Flag

```
seagull
```
