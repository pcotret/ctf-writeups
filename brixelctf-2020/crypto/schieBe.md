# Schei√üe

A german messenger was caught during WW2 He was carrying a piece of paper that read: *qbhbh zrmua gfbld ocqbv* He was nice enough to give us all we wanted, except the decoded  message, he needs a special machine for that, and we don't have it. He DID give us the settings for the machine. The settings for this machine are: Model: G-312 Reflector: UKW 11/26 Rotor 1: 2/12/6 Rotor 2: 1/17/16 Rotor 3: 3/12/1 The flag is ONE word, no spaces. do NOT translate the flag! **This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format**

## Walkthrough

German cipher often means Enigma. https://cryptii.com/pipes/enigma-machine has lots of settings for Enigma especially for the G-312 version. We get a German that can be translated in English.
