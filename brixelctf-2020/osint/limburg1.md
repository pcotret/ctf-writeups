# Visit Limburg 1

Welcome to Limburg! This beatiful province of Belgium offers so much to see and do! Let's say you want to take a nice bike ride from one side to the  other, but don't want to drive too much on roads where there are a lot  of cars driving. For this purpose we have a bike network! It tries to guide you as  much as possible over smaller roads and bike paths where cars  are not  allowed to drive. Let's start here: [Google maps link](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maastrichtersteenweg+201,+3770+Riemst/@50.8333603,5.637255,15.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c0e88b020d50a5:0x81a9e3b139856acb!8m2!3d50.8316796!4d5.6442194) and end here: [Google maps link](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Steenstortstraat,+3581+Beringen/@51.078121,5.2380936,16.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c13016b7f3699f:0xcf71d3a220658e79!8m2!3d51.0784705!4d5.2415842). The flag is the sum of all the nodes you pass on your trip (including the start and end nodes!) Happy cycling! **This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format**

## Walkthrough

After a quick Google search with keywords such as "limburg cycling map", we get this website where we can plan our trip: https://www.fietsroute.org/cycle-node-planner. On this map, nodes are the intersection of two roads. Then, we just need to add all numbers:
