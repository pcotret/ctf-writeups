# Manhunt 7

Can you tell me where he lives? Then I can drop some kind words in his mailbox! Format: brixelCTF{STREET_NUMBER_POSTALCODE_CITY} e.g brixelCTF{examplestreet_15_8500_kortrijk} **This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format** This is part of a series, more challenges will be unlocked once you  solve this one. While most challenges will be OSINT, some of them may  not be.

## Walkthrough

There's a contact page on Johnny's website: http://www.howitshould.be/contact. Even if we put random information, we get an address:

> Johnny Dorfmeister
> Melkvoetstraat 48
> 3500 Hasselt
>
> **Seriously, don't send anything to these people, I don't know them, it's only for the CTF! <= ^^**

## Flag
