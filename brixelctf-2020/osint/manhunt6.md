# Manhunt 6

 So he's a webdesigner huh? I wonder what his customers have to say about his work. In english please! **This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format** This is part of a series, more challenges will be unlocked once you  solve this one. While most challenges will be OSINT, some of them may  not be.

## Walkthrough

On http://www.howitshould.be/, there's a strange sentence written in cyrillic (probably Russian):

>  Есть свободный флаг: поэзия 

If we put it in Google Translate and ask for an English translation, we get the flag.

## Flag

```
poetry
```
