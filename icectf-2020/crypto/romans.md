# Romans

Can you decipher this ancient scripture?

```
Wh wg ibybckb vck sttsqhwjs hvs Qosgof qwdvsf kog oh hvs hwas, pih wh wg zwyszm hc vojs pssb fsogcbopzm gsqifs, bch zsogh psqoigs acgh ct Qosgof'g sbsawsg kcizr vojs pssb wzzwhsfohs obr chvsfg kcizr vojs oggiasr hvoh hvs asggousg ksfs kfwhhsb wb ob ibybckb tcfswub zobuious. WqsQHT{mci_hvciuvh_wh_kcizr_ps_fch13}
```

That looks like a basic substitution cipher.

Using https://www.dcode.fr/chiffre-cesar and a +14 shift:

```
It is unknown how effective the Caesar cipher was at the time, but it is likely to have been reasonably secure, not least because most of Caesar's enemies would have been illiterate and others would have assumed that the messages were written in an unknown foreign language.

```

## Solution

`IceCTF{you_thought_it_would_be_rot13}`
