# Astatine

## Challenge

Can you read the message?

```
5t4=2<(;4P0Q^YXDIYA21Ltn
```

## Solution

This string seems to be a bit similar to a base64, but not... Astatine (the chall title) is a chemical element which atomic number is 85.

After a quick search, there is an encoding algorithm called Ascii85/Base85 https://cryptii.com/pipes/ascii85-encoding
